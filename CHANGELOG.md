# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.2] - 2026-04-14

Major feature release — 15 new capabilities, 6 community PRs merged, 6 new MCP tools, 4 new languages, multi-format export, and graph analysis suite.

### Added

- **Hub node detection** (`get_hub_nodes_tool`): find the most-connected nodes in the codebase (architectural hotspots) by in+out degree, excluding File nodes.
- **Bridge node detection** (`get_bridge_nodes_tool`): find architectural chokepoints via betweenness centrality with sampling approximation for graphs >5000 nodes.
- **Knowledge gap analysis** (`get_knowledge_gaps_tool`): identify structural weaknesses — isolated nodes, thin communities (<3 members), untested hotspots, and single-file communities.
- **Surprise scoring** (`get_surprising_connections_tool`): composite scoring for unexpected architectural coupling (cross-community, cross-language, peripheral-to-hub, cross-test-boundary).
- **Suggested questions** (`get_suggested_questions_tool`): auto-generate prioritized review questions from graph analysis (bridge nodes, untested hubs, surprising connections, thin communities).
- **BFS/DFS traversal** (`traverse_graph_tool`): free-form graph exploration from any node with configurable depth (1-6) and token budget.
- **Edge confidence scoring**: three-tier system (EXTRACTED/INFERRED/AMBIGUOUS) with float confidence scores on all edges. Schema migration v9.
- **Export formats**: GraphML (Gephi/yEd/Cytoscape), Neo4j Cypher statements, Obsidian vault (wikilinks + YAML frontmatter + community pages), SVG static graph. CLI: `visualize --format graphml|cypher|obsidian|svg`.
- **Graph diff**: snapshot/compare graph state over time — new/removed nodes, edges, community membership changes.
- **Token reduction benchmark**: measure naive full-corpus tokens vs graph query tokens with per-question reduction ratios.
- **Memory/feedback loop**: persist Q&A results as markdown for re-ingestion via `save_result` / `list_memories` / `clear_memories`.
- **Oversized community auto-splitting**: communities exceeding 25% of graph are recursively split via Leiden algorithm.
- **4 new languages**: Zig, PowerShell, Julia, Svelte SFC (23 total).
- **Visualization enhancements**: node size scaled by degree, community legend with toggle visibility, improved interactivity.
- **README translations**: Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi.

### Merged community PRs

- **#127** (xtfer): SQLite compound edge indexes for query performance.

- Community detection uses resolution scaling for large graphs.
- Risk scoring uses weighted flow criticality and graduated test coverage.
- Dead code detection is framework-aware (ORM models, Pydantic, CDK constructs filtered).
- Flow entry points expanded with 30+ framework decorator patterns.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-11

Hotfix for the Windows long-running-MCP-tool hang that v2.2.4 only partially fixed.

### Fixed
- **Windows MCP hang on long-running tools** (PR #231, fixes #46, #136): follow-up to v2.2.4. [@dev-limucc reported on #136](https://github.com/tirth8205/code-review-graph/issues/136) that the `WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy` fix from v2.2.4 was necessary but not sufficient — read-only tools worked, but `build_or_update_graph_tool(full_rebuild=True)` and `embed_graph_tool` still hung indefinitely on Windows 11 / Python 3.14. Root cause: FastMCP 2.x dispatches sync handlers inline on the only event-loop thread, so handlers that run for more than a few seconds (especially those that spawn subprocesses or do CPU-bound inference) stop the loop from pumping stdin/stdout. **Fix**: converted the five heavy tools (`build_or_update_graph_tool`, `run_postprocess_tool`, `embed_graph_tool`, `detect_changes_tool`, `generate_wiki_tool`) to `async def` and offloaded the blocking work via `asyncio.to_thread`. The other 19 tools are fast SQLite-read paths and stay sync. Zero config, works on every platform. New regression tests assert the five tools are registered as coroutines AND that each one's source literally contains `asyncio.to_thread` as a defense-in-depth lock-in.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-11

Additive feature release — new language parsers, new platform install target, MCP tool UX improvements, and out-of-tree graph storage. No breaking changes from v2.2.4.

### Added

- **Elixir parser** (PR #228, closes #112): `.ex` and `.exs` files now produce modules as Class nodes, `def`/`defp`/`defmacro`/`defmacrop` as Function/Test nodes attached to their enclosing module, `alias`/`import`/`require`/`use` as `IMPORTS_FROM` edges, and everything else as `CALLS` edges. Internal call resolution walks into `do_block` bodies so `MathHelpers.double` correctly resolves its call to `Calculator.compute`.
- **Objective-C parser** (PR #227, closes #88): `.m` files parse classes (`@interface`, `@implementation`, `@protocol`), instance and class methods, `[receiver message:args]` message expressions, C-style `main()`, and `#import`/`#include`. Multi-part selectors like `add:to:` keep `add` as the canonical method name.
- **Bash/Shell parser** (PR #227, closes #197): `.sh`, `.bash`, and `.zsh` files parse functions, `command` invocations as `CALLS`, and `source path` / `. path` as `IMPORTS_FROM` edges with path resolution when the target file exists.
- **Qwen Code as a supported MCP install platform** (PR #227, closes #83): `code-review-graph install --platform qwen` writes a merged `~/.qwen/settings.json` using the same `mcpServers` schema as Cursor/Windsurf — it does not clobber existing Qwen config.
- **`apply_refactor_tool` dry-run mode** (PR #228, closes #176): new `dry_run: bool = False` parameter on the MCP tool and underlying `apply_refactor()` function. When true, returns a unified diff per file without touching disk and leaves the `refactor_id` valid for a follow-up real apply. Multi-edit files now apply sequentially against updated content in both modes (fixes a subtle bug where separate edits on the same file could stomp each other).
- **`CRG_DATA_DIR` environment variable** (PR #228, closes #155): when set, replaces the default `<repo>/.code-review-graph` directory verbatim. Useful for ephemeral workspaces, Docker volumes, shared CI caches, and multi-repo orchestrators. Supported by the CLI, MCP tools, and the registry.
- **`CRG_REPO_ROOT` environment variable** (PR #228, closes #155): `find_project_root()` now checks `CRG_REPO_ROOT` before the usual git-root walk — useful for anyone scripting the CLI from a cwd outside the target repo.
- **`install --no-instructions` and `-y`/`--yes` flags** (PR #228, closes #173): new flags on `code-review-graph install` to opt out of the `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/`.cursorrules`/`.windsurfrules` injection entirely (`--no-instructions`) or auto-confirm it without an interactive prompt (`-y`/`--yes`). The CLI also now prints the list of files it will touch before writing, so even without `--dry-run` users see what's coming.
- **Cloud embeddings stderr warning** (PR #228, closes #174): `get_provider()` now prints an explicit warning to stderr before returning a Google Gemini or MiniMax provider, explaining that source code will be sent to an external API. `CRG_ACCEPT_CLOUD_EMBEDDINGS=1` suppresses the warning for scripted workflows. The warning is on stderr only — it never writes to stdout or reads from stdin, so the MCP stdio transport remains uncorrupted.
- **TROUBLESHOOTING quick-reference** (PR #228): new top section in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` covering the four most common support questions — hook schema errors, `command not found` after pip install, project-vs-user scoping, and "built the graph but Claude Code doesn't see it".

### Fixed

- **Multi-edit refactor correctness** (PR #228): when a single `apply_refactor` call had multiple edits targeting the same file, the previous implementation re-read the file once per edit and could silently stomp earlier changes. The plan-computation step now groups edits by file and applies them sequentially against the updated content; this fix applies to both the real-write and the new dry-run path.

### Changed

- `install` and `init` commands now preview instruction-file targets before writing (no-op if nothing would change). This is always-on and does not require `--dry-run`.
- Default embedding path remains fully local (`sentence-transformers`); no behavior change unless you explicitly opt in to a cloud provider.

### Deprecated

Nothing.

### Security

- The cloud-embedding stderr warning (#174) is a privacy improvement; it does not change the behavior of offline local embeddings, which remain the default.

### Upgrade notes

- Nothing to do beyond `uvx --reinstall code-review-graph` or `pip install -U code-review-graph`. If you're coming from v2.2.2 or earlier, re-run `code-review-graph install` once to pick up the v2.2.3 hook schema rewrite.
- `CRG_DATA_DIR` is optional — if you don't set it, graphs continue to live at `<repo>/.code-review-graph` as before.
- VS Code extension v0.2.2 (from v2.2.4) still needs to be **repackaged and republished** separately; the PyPI `publish.yml` workflow does not cover it.

### Superseded PRs

- PR #204 (install preview, @lngyeen) — reimplemented cleanly in #228 with `isatty()`-guarded confirmation.
- PR #207 (`CRG_DATA_DIR`/`CRG_REPO_ROOT`, @yashmewada9618) — reimplemented cleanly in #228 without `input()`-on-stdio and `mcp._local_only` fragility.
- PR #179 (cloud embeddings warning, @Bakul2006) — reimplemented cleanly in #228 with stderr-only messaging and no stdio reads.

Credit to @lngyeen, @yashmewada9618, and @Bakul2006 for the original designs.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-04-11

Ships the 11 bugs from PR #222 plus the `v2.2.3.1` smoke-test hotfixes, for users upgrading directly from `v2.2.3` or earlier.

### Security
- **fastmcp bumped from 1.0 → ≥2.14.0** (PR #222, fixes #139, #195): closes CVE-2025-62800 (XSS), CVE-2025-62801 (command injection via server_name), CVE-2025-66416 (Confused Deputy). Transitively drops the `docket → fakeredis` chain that was broken by a `FakeConnection` → `FakeRedisConnection` rename in recent fakeredis releases (#195). The FastMCP public API (`FastMCP(name, instructions=...)`, `@mcp.tool()`, `@mcp.prompt()`, `mcp.run(transport="stdio")`) is unchanged across the 1 → 2 bump, so no source changes were needed beyond the pin. All 24 tools verified to register on fastmcp 2.14.6 and round-trip real per-repo data via stdio MCP in a 6-repo smoke test.

### Fixed
- **Windows build/embed hangs** (PR #222, fixes #46, #136): `main()` now sets `WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy` before `mcp.run()` on `sys.platform == "win32"`. The default `ProactorEventLoop` on Windows Python 3.8+ deadlocks with `ProcessPoolExecutor` (used by `full_build`) over a stdio MCP transport — producing the silent "Synthesizing…" hangs on `build` and `embed_graph_tool`. This is a no-op on macOS/Linux. **Note**: the fix was applied blind; maintainer could not verify on Windows. Please open a fresh issue if you still see a hang on v2.2.4 Windows with either `sentence-transformers` or Gemini providers.
- **Go method receivers** (PR #222, fixes #190): `func (s *T) Foo()` now attaches `Foo` to `T` as a member (`parent_name="T"`) with the usual `CONTAINS` edge instead of appearing as a top-level function. New `_get_go_receiver_type()` helper walks the method_declaration's first parameter_list to extract the receiver type name.
- **Dart parser — three bugs** (PR #222, fixes #87):
  - Dart `CALLS` edges (`_extract_dart_calls_from_children()`) — tree-sitter-dart doesn't wrap calls in a single `call_expression` node; the pattern is `identifier + selector > argument_part`. New walker handles both direct (`print('x')`) and method-chained (`obj.foo()`) shapes.
  - Dart `package:` URI resolution in `_do_resolve_module()` — `package:<pkgname>/<sub_path>` now walks up to a `pubspec.yaml` whose `name:` declaration matches `<pkgname>` and resolves to `<root>/lib/<sub_path>`.
  - `inheritors_of` bare-vs-qualified name mismatch in `tools/query.py` — falls back to `search_edges_by_target_name(node.name, kind=...)` for `INHERITS`/`IMPLEMENTS` when the qualified-name lookup returns nothing. Affects all languages (INHERITS targets are stored as bare strings for every language), not just Dart.
- **Nested `node_modules` and framework ignore defaults** (PR #222, fixes #91): `_should_ignore()` now treats single-segment `<dir>/**` patterns as "this directory at any depth", so `node_modules/**` also matches `packages/app/node_modules/react/index.js` inside monorepos. Extended `DEFAULT_IGNORE_PATTERNS` with Laravel/Composer (`vendor/**`, `bootstrap/cache/**`, `public/build/**`), Ruby (`.bundle/**`), Gradle (`.gradle/**`, `*.jar`), Flutter/Dart (`.dart_tool/**`, `.pub-cache/**`), and generic `coverage/**`, `.cache/**`. Deliberately did **not** add `packages/**` or `bin/**`/`obj/**` — those are false positives in yarn/pnpm workspace monorepos and .NET source trees respectively.
- **Bare `except Exception` cleanup** (PR #222, fixes #194): Replaced with specific exception classes + `logger.debug(...)` in 11 files (`cli.py`, `graph.py`, `migrations.py`, `parser.py`, `registry.py`, `tools/context.py`, `tsconfig_resolver.py`, `visualization.py`, `wiki.py`, `eval/benchmarks/search_quality.py`). No behavioral change; debuggability improvement.
- **Visualization auto-collapse hiding all edges** (PR #222, fixes #132): `visualization.py` no longer unconditionally auto-collapses every File node on page load. Auto-collapse now only kicks in above 2000 nodes — previously any graph above ~300 nodes would silently hide every CALLS/IMPORTS/INHERITS edge because they connect Functions/Classes nested inside the collapsed Files.
- **`eval` command crashes on `yaml.safe_load`** (PR #222, fixes #212): `eval.runner.load_all_configs()` now calls `_require_yaml()` before reading YAML, so users without `code-review-graph[eval]` installed get `ImportError: pyyaml is required: pip install code-review-graph[eval]` instead of `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'safe_load'`.

### VS Code extension (0.2.2)
- **`better-sqlite3` bumped 11.x → 12.x** (PR #222, fixes #218): VS Code 1.115 ships Electron 39 / V8 14.2 which removed `v8::Context::GetIsolate()`, the C++ API used by `better-sqlite3@11`. The extension couldn't activate at all — every command was undefined. `better-sqlite3@12.4.1+` (installs 12.8.0) uses the new V8 API and ships Electron 39 prebuilds. `@types/better-sqlite3: ^7.6.8 → ^7.6.13`, plus type-import adjustments in `src/backend/sqlite.ts` for the `Node16` module resolution and the new CJS `export =` types. Extension version bumped to 0.2.2. **Remember to repackage and republish the `.vsix`** — the existing `publish.yml` workflow only covers PyPI.

### Carried forward from 2.2.3.1
- `serve --repo <X>` is now honored by all 24 MCP tools (was only read by `get_docs_section_tool`). See #223.
- Wiki slug collisions no longer silently overwrite pages (~70% data loss on real repos). See #223.

### Upgrade notes
- `uvx --reinstall code-review-graph` or `pip install -U code-review-graph`, then re-run `code-review-graph install` (the 2.2.3 hook-schema rewrite is still a requirement if you're coming from 2.2.2 or earlier).
- VS Code extension needs to be repackaged + republished separately; the Python release does not include it.

## [2.2.3.1] - 2026-04-11

Hotfix on top of 2.2.3 for two bugs surfaced by a full first-time-user smoke test against six real OSS repos (express, fastapi, flask, gin, httpx, next.js).

### Fixed
- **`serve --repo <X>` was ignored by 21 of 24 MCP tools** (PR #223): `main.py` captured the `--repo` CLI flag into `_default_repo_root`, but only `get_docs_section_tool` read it. The other 21 `@mcp.tool()` wrappers all took `repo_root: Optional[str] = None` and passed that straight through to the impl, which fell back to `find_repo_root()` from cwd. The real-world blast radius is small — the `install` command writes `.mcp.json` without a `--repo` flag and Claude Code launches the server with `cwd=<repo>` — but anyone scripting `serve` manually or running a multi-repo orchestrator would silently get the wrong graph. Added a single `_resolve_repo_root()` helper with explicit precedence (client arg > `--repo` flag > `None → cwd`) and threaded it through all 24 wrappers. New unit tests cover the precedence rules.
- **Wiki slug collisions silently overwrote pages** (PR #223): `_slugify()` folds non-alphanumerics to dashes and truncates to 80 chars, so similar community names collided (`"Data Processing"`, `"data processing"`, `"Data  Processing"` all → `data-processing.md`). `generate_wiki()` wrote each community to `<slug>.md` regardless, so later iterations overwrote earlier files while the counter reported them as "updated". On the express smoke test this was **~70% silent data loss** (32 real files vs 107 claimed pages). Fixed by tracking used slugs per-run and appending `-2`, `-3`, … until unique. Every community now gets its own page; the counter matches the physical file count; `get_wiki_page()` still resolves by name via the existing partial-match fallback. New regression test monkey-patches three colliding names and asserts no content loss.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed
- **Claude Code hook schema** (PR #208, fixes #97, #138, #163, #168, #172, #182, #188, #191, #201): `generate_hooks_config()` now emits the valid v1.x+ Claude Code schema — every hook entry has `matcher` + a nested `hooks: [{type, command, timeout}]` array, and timeouts are in seconds. The invalid `PreCommit` event has been removed; pre-commit checks are now installed as a real git hook via `install_git_hook()`. Users upgrading from 2.2.2 must re-run `code-review-graph install` to rewrite `.claude/settings.json`.
- **SQLite transaction nesting** (PR #205, fixes #110, #135, #181): `GraphStore.__init__` now connects with `isolation_level=None`, disabling Python's implicit transactions that were the root cause of `sqlite3.OperationalError: cannot start a transaction within a transaction` on `update`. `store_file_nodes_edges` adds a defensive `in_transaction` flush before `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`.
- **Go method receivers** (PR #166): `_extract_name_from_node` now resolves Go method names from `field_identifier` inside `method_declaration`, fixing method names that were previously picked up as the result type (e.g. `int64`) instead of the method name.
- **UTF-8 decode errors in `detect_changes`** (PR #170, fixes #169): Diff parsing now uses `errors="replace"` so diffs containing binary files no longer crash the tool.
- **`--platform` target scope** (PR #142, fixes #133): `code-review-graph install --platform <target>` now correctly filters skills, hooks, and instruction files so you only get configuration for the requested platform.
- **Large-repo community detection hangs** (PR #213, PR #183): Removed recursive sub-community splitting, capped Leiden at `n_iterations=2`, and batched `store_communities` writes. 100k+ node graphs no longer hang in `_compute_summaries`.
- **CI**: ruff lint + `tomllib` on Python 3.10 (PR #220) — `tests/test_skills.py` now uses a conditional `tomli` backport on 3.10, `N806`/`E501`/`W291` fixes in `skills.py`/`communities.py`/`parser.py`, and the embedded `noqa` reference in `visualization.py` was rephrased so ruff stops parsing it as a directive.
- **Missing dev dependencies** (PR #159): `pytest-cov` added to dev extras, 50 ruff errors swept, one failing test fixed.
- **JSX component CALLS edges** (PR #154): JSX component usage now produces CALLS edges so component-to-component relationships appear in the graph.

### Added
- **Codex platform install support** (PR #177): `code-review-graph install --platform codex` appends a `mcp_servers.code-review-graph` section to `~/.codex/config.toml` without overwriting existing Codex settings.
- **Luau language support** (PR #165, closes #153): Roblox Luau (`.luau`) parsing — functions, classes, local functions, requires, tests.
- **REFERENCES edge type** (PR #217): New edge kind for symbol references that aren't direct calls (map/dispatch lookups, string-keyed handlers), including Python and TypeScript patterns.
- **`recurse_submodules` build option** (PR #215): Build/update can now optionally recurse into git submodules.
- **`.gitignore` default for `.code-review-graph/`** (PR #185): Fresh installs automatically add the SQLite DB directory to `.gitignore` so the database isn't accidentally committed.
- **Clearer gitignore docs** (PR #171, closes #157): Documentation now spells out that `code-review-graph` already respects `.gitignore` via `git ls-files`.

### Changed
- Community detection is now bounded — large repos complete in reasonable time instead of hanging indefinitely.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Kotlin call extraction**: `simple_identifier` + `navigation_expression` support for Kotlin method calls (PR #107)
- **JUnit/Kotlin test detection**: Annotation-based test classification (`@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, etc.) for Java/Kotlin/C# (PR #107)

### Fixed
- **Windows encoding crash**: All `write_text`/`read_text` calls in `skills.py` now use `encoding='utf-8'` explicitly (PR #152, fixes #147, #148)
- **Invalid `--quiet` flag in hooks**: Removed non-existent `--quiet` and `--json` flags from generated hook commands (PR #152, fixes #149)

### Housekeeping
- Untracked `.claude-plugin/` directory and added to `.gitignore`

## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Parser recursion guard**: Added `_MAX_AST_DEPTH = 180` limit to `_extract_from_tree()` preventing stack overflow on deeply nested ASTs
- **Module cache bound**: Added `_MODULE_CACHE_MAX = 15_000` with automatic eviction to prevent unbounded memory growth in `_module_file_cache`
- **Embeddings thread safety**: Added `check_same_thread=False` to `EmbeddingStore` SQLite connection
- **Embeddings retry logic**: Added `_call_with_retry()` with exponential backoff for Google Gemini API calls
- **Visualization XSS hardening**: Added `</` to `<\/` replacement in JSON serialization to prevent script injection
- **CLI error handling**: Split broad `except` into specific `json.JSONDecodeError` and `(KeyError, TypeError)` handlers
- **Git timeout**: Made configurable via `CRG_GIT_TIMEOUT` environment variable (default 30s)

### Added
- **Governance files**: Added CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- **Project URLs**: Added Homepage, Repository, Issues, Changelog URLs to pyproject.toml metadata

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **C# parsing broken**: Renamed language identifier from `c_sharp` to `csharp` to match `tree-sitter-language-pack`'s actual identifier. Previously, all C# files were silently skipped because `_get_parser()` swallowed the `LookupError`.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Add missing `max_nodes` parameter to `get_impact_radius` method signature (caused `NameError` at runtime)
- Fix `.gitignore` test assertion to match expanded comment format

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-17

### Security
- **Prompt injection mitigation**: Node names are now sanitized (control characters stripped, length capped at 256) before appearing in MCP tool responses, preventing graph-laundered prompt injection attacks
- **Path traversal protection**: `repo_root` parameter now validates that the target directory contains a `.git` or `.code-review-graph` directory, preventing arbitrary file exfiltration via MCP tools
- **VSCode RCE fix**: `cliPath` setting is now scoped to `machine` level only, preventing malicious workspace settings from pointing to attacker-controlled binaries
- **XSS fix in visualization**: `escH()` now escapes quotes and backticks in addition to angle brackets, closing stored XSS via crafted node names in generated HTML
- **SRI for CDN assets**: D3.js script tag now includes `integrity` and `crossorigin` attributes to prevent CDN compromise
- **Secure nonce generation**: VSCode webview CSP nonces now use `crypto.randomBytes()` instead of `Math.random()`
- **Symlink protection**: Build, watch mode, and file collection now skip symbolic links to prevent parsing files outside the repository
- **TOCTOU elimination**: File bytes are now read once, then hashed and parsed from the same buffer, closing the time-of-check-to-time-of-use gap

### Fixed
- **Thread-safe NetworkX cache**: Added `threading.Lock` around graph cache reads/writes to prevent race conditions between watch mode and MCP request handling
- **BFS resource limits**: Impact radius traversal now caps at 500 nodes to prevent memory exhaustion on dense graphs
- **SQL parameter batching**: `get_edges_among` now batches queries to stay under SQLite's variable limit on large node sets
- **Database path leakage**: Improved `.gitignore` inside `.code-review-graph/` with explicit warnings about absolute paths in the database

### Changed
- **Pinned dependency bounds**: All dependencies now have upper-bound version constraints to mitigate supply-chain risks

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Watch mode thread safety**: SQLite connections now use `check_same_thread=False` for Python 3.10/3.11 compatibility with watchdog's background threads
- **Full rebuild stale data**: `full_build` now purges nodes/edges from files deleted since last build
- **Removed unused dependency**: `gitpython` was listed in dependencies but never imported — removed to shrink install footprint
- **Stale Docker reference**: Removed non-existent Docker image suggestion from Python version check

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **`install` command** — primary entry point for new users (`code-review-graph install`). `init` remains as an alias for backwards compatibility.
- **`--dry-run` flag** on `install`/`init` — shows what would be written without modifying files
- **PyPI publish workflow** — GitHub releases now automatically publish to PyPI via API token
- **Professional README** — complete rewrite with real benchmark data:
  - Code reviews: 6.8x average token reduction (tested on httpx, FastAPI, Next.js)
  - Live coding tasks: 14.1x average, up to 49.1x on large repos

### Changed
- README restructured around the install-and-forget user experience
- CLI banner now shows `install` as the primary command

## [1.6.4] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **Portable MCP config**: `init` now generates `uvx`-based `.mcp.json` instead of absolute Python paths — works on any machine with `uv` installed
- Removed `_safe_path` symlink workaround (no longer needed with `uvx`)

## [1.6.3] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **SessionStart hook** — Claude Code now automatically prefers graph MCP tools over full codebase scans at the start of every session, saving tokens on general queries
- `homepage` and `author.url` fields in plugin.json for marketplace discoverability

### Fixed
- plugin.json schema: renamed `tags` to `keywords`, removed invalid `skills` path (auto-discovered from default location)
- Removed screenshot placeholder section from README

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Incremental hash comparison bug — `file_hash` read from wrong field, causing every file to re-parse
- Watch mode `on_deleted` handler now filters by ignore patterns
- Removed dead code in `full_build` and duplicate `main()` in `incremental.py`
- `get_staged_and_unstaged` handles git renamed files (`R old -> new`)
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md hook config path corrected

### Added
- **Parser: C/C++ support** — full node extraction (structs, classes, functions, includes, calls, inheritance)
- **Parser: name extraction** fixes for Kotlin/Swift (`simple_identifier`), Ruby (`constant`), C/C++ nested `function_declarator`
- `GraphStore` context manager (`__enter__`/`__exit__`)
- `get_all_edges()` and `get_edges_among()` public methods on `GraphStore`
- NetworkX graph caching with automatic invalidation on writes
- Subprocess timeout (30s) on all git calls
- Progress logging every 50 files in full build
- SHA-256 hashing in embeddings (replaced MD5)
- Chunked embedding search (`fetchmany(500)`)
- Batch edge collection in `get_impact_radius` (single SQL query)
- ARIA labels throughout D3.js visualization
- **CI**: Coverage enforcement (`--cov-fail-under=50`), bandit security scanning, mypy type checking
- **Tests**: `test_incremental.py` (24 tests), `test_embeddings.py` (16 tests)
- **Test fixtures**: C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Swift with multilang test classes
- **Docs**: API response schemas in COMMANDS.md, ignore patterns in USAGE.md

## [1.5.3] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- `init` now auto-creates symlinks when paths contain spaces (macOS iCloud, OneDrive, etc.)
- `build`, `status`, `visualize`, `watch` work without a git repository (falls back to cwd)
- Skills discoverable via plugin.json (`name` field added to SKILL.md frontmatter)

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **File organization**: All generated files now live in `.code-review-graph/` directory instead of repo root
  - Auto-created `.gitignore` inside the directory prevents accidental commits
  - Automatic migration from legacy `.code-review-graph.db` at repo root
- **Visualization: start collapsed**: Only File nodes visible on load; click to expand children
- **Visualization: search bar**: Filter nodes by name or qualified name in real-time
- **Visualization: edge type toggles**: Click legend items to show/hide edge types (Calls, Imports, Inherits, Contains)
- **Visualization: scale-aware layout**: Force simulation adapts charge, distance, and decay for large graphs (300+ nodes)

### Changed
- Database path: `.code-review-graph.db` → `.code-review-graph/graph.db`
- HTML visualization path: `.code-review-graph.html` → `.code-review-graph/graph.html`
- `.code-review-graph/**` added to default ignore patterns (prevents self-indexing)

### Removed
- `references/` directory (duplicate of `docs/`, caused stale path references)
- `agents/` directory (unused, not wired into any code)
- `settings.json` at repo root (decorative, not loaded by code)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- `init` command: automatic `.mcp.json` setup for Claude Code integration
- `visualize` command: interactive D3.js force-directed graph visualization
- `serve` command: start MCP server directly from CLI

### Changed
- Comprehensive documentation overhaul across all reference files

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Universal installation: now works with `pip install code-review-graph[embeddings]` on Python 3.10+
- CLI entry point (`code-review-graph` command works after normal pip install)
- Clear Python version check with helpful Docker fallback for older Python users
- Improved README installation section with one-command + Docker option

### Changed
- Minimum Python requirement lowered from 3.11 → 3.10 (covers ~90% of users)

### Fixed
- Installation friction for most developers
